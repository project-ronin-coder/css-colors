    rgb(red, green, blue);

    - Each red, green, and blue value is a number from 0 to 255. 0 means that there's 0% of that color, and is black. 255 means that there's 100% of that color.

    Section for CSS HEX or Hexadecimal Colors

    #4B5320

    A very common way to apply color to an element with CSS is with hexadecimal or hex values.

    Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue.

    You may already be familiar with decimal, or base 10 values, which go from 0 - 9. Hexadecimal, or base 16 values, go from 0 - 9, then A - F:

    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

    With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. 
    
    So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).

    Section for CSS HSL or Hue, Saturation, and Lightness

    hsl(50, 50%, 50%)

    The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

    If you imagine a color wheel, 
    
    the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

    Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.

    Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.

    Section for Linear Gradient

    A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.

    One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value.
