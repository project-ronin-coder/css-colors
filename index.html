    rgb(red, green, blue);

    - Each red, green, and blue value is a number from 0 to 255. 0 means that there's 0% of that color, and is black. 255 means that there's 100% of that color.

    Section for CSS HEX or Hexadecimal Colors

    #4B5320

    A very common way to apply color to an element with CSS is with hexadecimal or hex values.

    Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue.

    You may already be familiar with decimal, or base 10 values, which go from 0 - 9. Hexadecimal, or base 16 values, go from 0 - 9, then A - F:

    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

    With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. 
    
    So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).
